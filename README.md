# Three Four One Two

Visit the live application here: https://threefouronetwo.onrender.com/ Works best if you get some friends to click the link too ;).

ThreeFourOneTwo is a web application for collective music sequence making. When you arrive to the site you appear as a blue dot within a cube. Anyone else currently on the site will appear as a red dot. As the yellow frame passes your dot, a note is played. The user can control the timing, pitch, sustain and distortion of their note based on their position within the cube. They control this using simple keyboard controls.

ThreeFourOneTwo runs on a custom server using the WebSocket API, uses the Web Audio API to synthesize sounds, and Three.js for the visualization.
